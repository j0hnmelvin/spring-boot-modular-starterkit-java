# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

### Intent of Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This promotes loose coupling and allows the code to work with different object families depending on a configuration or environment.

### Example of Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Action

This example demonstrates how the Abstract Factory pattern can be used to create platform-specific UI elements (buttons and text boxes) based on the operating system.

#### Components

- **Abstract Factory**: Responsible for creating platform-specific factories.
- **Factory (Interface)**: Defines an interface for creating buttons and text boxes.
- **Concrete Factories (MacFactory, WindowsFactory)**: Implements the Factory interface and create specific button and textbox objects for their respective platforms (Mac and Windows).
- **Button, TextBox (Interfaces)**: Defines the common functionalities of buttons and text boxes.
- **Concrete Buttons/Text Boxes (MacButton, WindowsButton, MacTextBox, WindowsTextBox)**: Implements the specific visual and behavior details of buttons and text boxes for each platform.
